            Aeroglobe is a fictional company I came up with for my security exam project, where I aimed to build a secure website in PHP.
            During the process I focused on security from start til the end, in order to avoid
            adding a weak level of security as a last addition. I found the project very fun and it was very interesting to learn about
            the different attacks, such as SQL injection, CSRF and DDos etc. With PHP there is a saying that it is a more insecure language and therefore
            I found it interesting to research some of the inbuild options of securing a website built in php. Given PHP's reputation for potential vulnerabilities,
            I delved into its built-in security features, emphasizing the necessity of utilizing up-to-date PHP versions equipped with enhanced security tools.
            Additionally, I also looked at important factors such as HTTP and HTTPS in order to secure requests between the server and the client.
            But also aquired knowledge about topics such as the three pillars of security and structural security.
            Some of the methods I used for securing the website was by using prepared statements, validate and sanitize user input,
            hashing passwords and securing sessions and file uploads.
            Lastly I made sure to check the level of security during the process, with the help of Snyk, a testing tool.
