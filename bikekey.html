            My internship at Bikekey was an incredibly fun and educational time, which contributed to my personal growth.
            Here I got to work with technologies such as React, and got more comftable with writing and understanding Javascript.
            I mostly worked on the frontend part but also did a little testing in cypress, where I got to write and run tests.
            It was also during the internship that I got more comftable with using git, and learned about new commands and methods
            to maintain clean, isolated code branches.
            During the process, I worked in Zeplin which made the process of going from design til development, much smoother.
            I also worked in Figma, when I got the opportunity of giving my take on designing a new feature for the platform.
            <br><br>
            Overall I gained a lot from the internship, which both gave me insight in the process of going from design to product delivery,
            but it also bolstered my confidence in experimenting with code, and embracing creative problem-solving, when faced with technical challenges.
